Want erasure code without needing to do finite field arithmetic for q > 2.

Model:
Data is an (n⋅k)-vector.
Want to generate m outputs each of which is an n-vector each such that any k of
the m suffice to reconstruct the original data.

Each of the m outputs can be given by a linear transform

A_j ∈ Hom(F_2^{n⋅k}, F_2^n).

We can combine matrices (A, B) by doing
 [A  B] ∈ Hom(F_2^{n⋅k}, F_2^{2n})

Claim:
[I 0 0  0  0  0]
[0 I 0  0  0  0]
[0 0 I  0  0  0]
[0 0 0  I  0  0]
[0 0 0  0  I  0]
[0 0 0  0  0  I]
[I I I  I  I  I]
[I M M2 M4 M8 M16]

Any 6 rows of the above will make an invertible matrix.


Require n to be sufficiently big (e.g. 1024 should be plenty)
